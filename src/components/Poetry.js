             <h2>My Recent Poem: HUMAN PSYCHE</h2>
    <p>
        One day I was seated on a three-legged stool,<br></br>
        Deep in a close-knit forest in Taita, Home to half of my heritage<br></br>
        I had my spectacles on, big ones,<br></br>
        Gruel cooling at the side,<br></br>
        An excavator must have been working gold at a nearby mine<br></br>
        I wished it could mine the gold in my heart, eehm,<br></br>
        There was loud rumbling and also pin-drop silence<br></br>
        I saw the human psyche in its splendour and also its gruesomeness,<br></br>
        The soul was green and marching,<br></br>
        The mind was in blue and flying, flirting with heights,<br></br>
        The spirit was in golden yellow and jumping, like a butterfly.<br></br>
        All were road-worthy,<br></br>
        And they asked me to be their driver,<br></br>
        To somewhere,<br></br>
        Where it rains but does not pour,<br></br>
        Or where happiness is everywhere!<br></br>

      <h2>My Other Poem: Helicopter Parenting</h2>
      
      <p>
      Helicopter Parenting<br></br>
      Grew up in Muluwa,<br></br>
      Oh the nostalgia of village life<br></br>
      A low pressure childhood,<br></br>
      With a lot more freedom and independence,<br></br>
      A fair share of failures and struggles,<br></br>
      Look at today's child,<br></br>A little buffoon who cannot do mchongoano,<br></br>
      Weak and very sensitive,<br></br>
      Baby seated and made to rot,<br></br>
      In character and discipline,<br></br>
      Helicopter parented!
